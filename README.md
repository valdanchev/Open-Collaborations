# Open-Collaborations

Open Collaborations is a Mozilla Open Leaders Project

In many online communities and open kitchens nowadays, individual contributions and exchanges are openly available. Yet, in science, one of the first activity that was historically opened for public scrutiny in modern societies, the very process of doing research collaboratively is nowadays a relatively closed system. 

Open Collaborations aims at bringing together people interested in using the potential of blockchain technology for fostering open distributed collaboration. 

Our short-term goal is to assemble insights from technologies such as blockchain that can directly increase the transparency of collaboration and minimize gender, status, and related biases in collaborative research.

Ultimately, our goal would be to prototype an open source platform that integrates distributed scientific contributions among collaborators, from ideation to outcome, based on blockchain technology. The prototype will aim to contribute to a more open, inclusive, and reproducible collaborative research by assembling traceable bits of contributions necessary for assigning credit.
